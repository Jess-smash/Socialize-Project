                    <p><b>My name is Jessica Plancarte Lopez. I was born in San Jose and raised there for two-thirds of my life. My early life consisted of a lot of moving and a single mom. I was born on July 22nd of 2002 and at this moment I am 15 years old. A lot has happened throughout these fifteen years, there have been ups and downs. I have been to 6 different schools from the moment I began school. Interestingly, I began school at the age of 3 because a spot was open at the preschool my mom was applying me for and since she had to work a lot they allowed me to enter but that meant I had to take 2 years of preschool to stay aligned with the average kid my age. From then on I went to school like the average kid my age but I did move around quite a bit after that. <br><br>            
                        
                        Now...
                        <br><br>
                        My mom eventually remarried the man which I now consider my dad and we have been stabalized in San Jose for quite some time. I attend Latino College Preparatory in San Jose, CA and I am a sophomore at the time being. I enjoy trying out new things and exploring a variety of options. I don't like limiting myself to one thing, making me ambiguous but zealous. I want to do everything at the same time when I barley have time. Right now I am playing soccer for my school's soccer team and since we only have varsity, I made it to our varsity soccer team but that doesn't mean I'm like a pro or anything. This is one of the new things I decided to try out but even though I don't have any real expirence in something, I put all my effort into it if I am going to take the opportunity. If you take an opportunity that could have been someone else's, at least use it to it's fullest.
